# Code of Conduct 🤝

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in my projects! Whether you're trying out a tool, contributing open source code, reporting a bug, or just exploring, I want this to be a space where everyone feels welcome.

## My Commitment

I am committed to keeping these projects free from harassment and discrimination for everyone, regardless of:

- Age, gender, gender identity or expression
- Sexual orientation
- Disability (visible or invisible)
- Physical appearance
- Level of technical experience
- Education or socioeconomic status
- Nationality, ethnicity, race or religion
- Any other personal characteristic

## What I Expect

### Behaviors that foster a positive community ✨

- **Be kind and respectful**: We're all here to learn and create great things
- **Give constructive feedback**: If something can be improved, share it helpfully and kindly
- **Accept criticism with an open mind**: Nobody is perfect; we're all improving
- **Think of the community**: Not just our own interests
- **Assume good intentions**: Give the benefit of the doubt before reacting
- **Help others**: Especially those who are just starting out

### Unacceptable Behaviors ❌

- Sexualized language or images, harassment, or unwanted advances
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks
- Harassment of any kind, public or private
- Sharing others' private information without explicit permission
- Spam or unsolicited advertising
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Scope

This code applies to:

- **GitHub repositories**: Issues, PRs, discussions, code
- **Social media**: When representing these projects
- **Direct communication**: Emails, messages related to the projects
- **Events**: Any space where these projects are discussed

Basically: if you are interacting about any of my projects, this code applies.

## What Do I Do If I See a Problem?

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Report**: Send an email to **hello@gohit.xyz**
2. **Describe**: What happened, when, and who was involved (if possible)
3. **Trust**: I will review all reports promptly, fairly, and confidentially

Your privacy and safety are important. Reports are handled discreetly.

## Consequences

Depending on severity, actions may include:

### Minor Violation
- Private warning explaining the issue
- Request for a public apology (if appropriate)

### Moderate Violation
- Formal warning
- Temporary restriction of interaction in project spaces
- May escalate to temporary ban if it continues

### Serious Violation
- Temporary ban (days, weeks, or months depending on the case)
- Prohibition from interacting with the project and community

### Severe Violation
- Permanent ban from all projects
- Blocking future contributions

## A Personal Note

These projects are a labor of love. Some are useful tools, others are experiments, and all aim to contribute something. I want them to be places where people can collaborate, learn, and have fun creating.

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate, ask. It's better to clarify than assume.
